            <h1>Bike Routes From the Summer of 2020</h1>
            <p>In the summer of 2020 my girlfriend, Jenna and I had to come up with activities to do with everything closed down due to the pandemic. We decided that our free time would be best spent going on bike rides. Originally we just taking leisurely rides to the park to enjoy the weather and get some exercise, but fell in love with it and started going on longer and longer rides, eventually training for and completing a century ride (100 miles) by the end of the summer. These are some of the routes we took:</p>

                    <p>Starting out during the summer, we would frequent riding to Tower Grove Park since it was the closest park to our house that is big enough for a somewhat lengthy bike ride. Since Tower Grove Park is only around 2 miles around, we would usually go around a couple of times and enjoy the scenery.

                    <p>Of course, urban cycling in St. Louis isn’t complete without hitting up Forest Park. It’s close enough to home and bigger than Tower Grove Park which lets us get more out of the rides. Although a bit crowded, Forest Park is an excellent spot for a casual, laid back ride.

                    <p>Whenever we were feeling up to a longer ride, we would ride all the way to the beautiful River Despair (River Des Peres). A large portion of the “river” is lined with great bike paths that made for longer rides with a change of scenery, even if it’s not the most beautiful of places.

                    <p>As beautiful and smelly as the River Des Peres trail is, we were very thankful that the non-profit, Great Rivers Greenway opened up a new connecting path to the infamous Grant’s Trail. This created a safe way for hundreds of cyclists to enjoy it’s lengthy and beautiful paths . Taking this route became a regular weekend activity for us taking up a large portion our mornings/afternoons. Riding this trail is when we decided we were going to train to ride a century which, in turn, gave us plenty of opportunities to say hello to our Clydesdale friends.

                    <p>After riding the length of Grant’s Trail for what seemed like a thousand times, we were itching for some new scenery and unexplored bike paths. We set out to explore the excellent Madison County Bike Trails, plus our favorite coffee roasters opened up their first cafe in Edwardsville, so we picked the obvious destination. Although getting to the trail involved riding through North St. Louis City and a small portion of East St. Louis in the early hours of the morning, it was one of our most proud accomplishments of the summer and was a huge milestone. Plus we got some very tasty coffee beverages!

                    <p>When preparing for our century, we decided it would be most fun to find a destination that is roughly 100 miles away and ride there. We found that Springfield Illinois was almost exactly 100 miles away with the route we took. We booked a hotel room, left a car at the hotel and set off the following day from the Mckinley bridge just across the Mississippi from St. Louis. After just over 7 hours of riding, we made it to our destination exhausted and ready to eat all of the calories that our hearts desired!</p>
